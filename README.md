##### Two Deep Learning CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models are proposed :- 
1) ResNet (Residual Network) Classifier Model – To confirm the possibility of a brain tumor. 
2) ResUNet Segmentation Model – To detect the exact location of the tumor. 

The methodology of Transfer Learning is applied to re-train these Models in order to perform the classification and localization of tumors through the Brain MRI scans. Transfer Learning is used since starting from a pretrained model can drastically reduce the computational time required if the training is performed from scratch.
